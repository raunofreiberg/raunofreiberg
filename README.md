Hiya, I'm **Rauno** — a senior software engineer with a soft spot for design systems and user interfaces. ✨

Currently, I'm building front-end tooling with the incredible team at [▲ Vercel](https://vercel.com).

On the side, I apply my learnings, research, and experience with design systems for open-source by documenting components at [UI Playbook](http://uiplaybook.dev/) and experimenting with user interfaces at [uiwtf](https://uiw.tf).

## Things I care about (in no particular order)

🎉 Wonderful micro-interactions and attention to detail

💻 Reusable, consistent, and accessible components for engineers

♿️ Thoughtful and accessible experiences for end users
