### 👋

Hiya, I'm **Rauno** — a senior software engineer with a soft spot for design systems and user interfaces. ✨

Up until recently, I led the engineering of [Veriff's](https://veriff.com) design system Genoma, where I grew the component library to 30+ accessible and reusable React components, used by all user-facing services up to 700+ instances in production.

Today, I'm working on [UI Playbook](http://uiplaybook.dev/), the documented collection of UI components, where I apply my learnings, research, and experience with design systems for open-source.

## Things I care about (in no particular order)

- Wonderful micro-interactions and attention to detail 🎉

- Reusable, consistent, and accessible components for engineers 💻

- Thoughtful and accessible experiences for end users ♿️

- ...and road cycling! 🚴‍

I'm open to new opportunities, so if it feels like we share common interests — drop me a line!

✌️
